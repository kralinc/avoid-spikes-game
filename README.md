# avoid-spikes-game
A little game I made in a day earlier this January. Later I added a score system.

WASD or the arrow keys moves your character (the white square).
Avoid the red squares.
Press ESC to exit the program.

The source code for each of these versions is held in source/AvoidSpikesGame.pde
